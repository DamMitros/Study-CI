1k9u9aa,"Is it just me, or do the recent widespread power outages in Portugal, Spain, and parts of France seem suspicious?",Agreeable_Drama_2545,conspiracytheories,"I’ve been following the news about the large-scale power outages that hit Portugal, Spain, and even parts of France. Official reports are still vague about the cause, mostly pointing to “technical failures” or “grid instability.” But given the current geopolitical climate, I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to it.

Could this be the result of coordinated cyberattacks?
We know that state-sponsored hacker groups, especially from Russia, have been increasing their cyber operations across Europe. Targeting the power grid would be a strategic move - it causes chaos without direct military engagement, and it sends a clear message without a shot being fired.

The timing also feels a bit too convenient, with growing tensions between Russia and Western Europe over various political and economic issues.

I’m not saying I have proof, but the pieces seem to fit. What do you think? Is this just an unfortunate coincidence, or could there be a hidden cyberwar going on right under our noses?

1k9tcyv,​⚠️ Major Power Outages Across Western Europe — Stay Alert and Prepared,Content_NoIndex,EuroPreppers,"As of today, April 28, 2025, vast regions of Spain and Portugal have experienced widespread electrical blackouts, resulting in significant disruptions to daily life. The outages have affected key infrastructure, including airports and metro systems in major cities, leading to significant disruptions in transportation and communication. ​

The cause of the blackout remains unspecified, and the situation is still unfolding. Authorities are working to restore power and stabilize affected systems. ​

Given the scale of these outages, it's a timely reminder for everyone to review their preparedness plans:​

Ensure you have sufficient water and non-perishable food supplies.

It's not just railways the entire country has lost all power: traffic lights don't work, many supermarkets have closed, phone systems and hospitals switched to backup generators. The Spanish grid operator expects power to be restored between 9PM and 1AM

The power outage also means that trains have come to a stop, there are reports of people stuck in metro tunnels for hours, likewise many high-speed rail passengers are stuck in the middle of nowhere. Spain is relatively sparsely populated in-between cities so there aren't many places to go to.

1ka2av2,Get a radio. Now.,flowerlovingatheist,TwoXPreppers,"I cannot stress this enough.

I believe I haven't seen it mentioned on this subreddit yet, but today, 28 Apr 2025, there was a power outage in all of the Iberian peninsula – the entirety of the Iberian territories of Portugal and Spain, and even parts of Northern France, were completely left without power. I do not live there, but I have a friend who does.

I talked with her over text after her area regained power, and one of the things that struck out to me is how absolutely helpless you'd be in that situation. Most people do not realise how much we depend on electricity. And when we lose it, the consequences are greater than many would expect. Panic. Misinformation. Fearmongering. Civil unrest.

Why does this happen? Simple. Although network-distributing antennae are generally connected to backup generators, in emergency situations, they get throttled to prioritise more important connections. People find themselves unable to get access to any kind of information. My friend couldn't text anyone or find out what was happening.

What helped her? An old radio she found in some dusty closet. Because even when there is no power, radios continue working. Getting inteligence is extremely important in these sorts of situations. I know it may sound cringey, but the phrase “knowledge is power” really does apply here. In this case, the outage didn't last that long, but what if It had? How would my friend have been aware of the current situation, how would she have informed herself of whether there might be riots, despertate robbers, vandals, whether infrastructure continued to retain its integrity, whether public service and healthcare were active, whether there was an imminent threat to safety?

I'm not even talking about an amateur radio or anything alike, although that would probably be good too. Just your average cheap £10 AM/FM radio you can easily find in any electronics shop. Yes, that shitty looking thing powered on AAAs is better than nothing. Do it. Purchase it now. Right now. Because access to information is the most important factor in emergencies. Without access to information, you are no one. And you *really* don't want to wait until it's too late.

Edit: to all of the geniuses telling people to use the radio in their cars with a condescending tone as if it was so obvious, here in Europe we actually have a stable system of proper public transportation in contrast to the US, which means that many people do not own cars, simply because they don't need them. Stop assuming everything is like it is in your country. Not to mention that sources of information should always be portable. You aren't sounding as smart as you think you are.",3996,2025-04-28 18:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1ka2av2/get_a_radio_now/

1kaqlxm,Preparing for Major Power Outage in Portugal & Spain,coniunctisumus,digitalnomad,"There was a major power outage in all of Portugal in Spain yesterday (28 April) and I almost had to sleep on the street in Porto.

Flying by the seat of your pants is fun and easy, but it only works if all the services we take for granted are working as expected.

I've reflected on this situation and how to prepare for future emergency-type scenarios.

**This was my situation:**

* Very little cash, only enough to buy some peanuts and a few bus tickets (bad move, I usually carry a few hundred in emergency money, even though money changers weren't working)
* No offline map (I thought I had already downloaded one for Porto)
* Did not communicate with my host (leading them to cancel my booking and book my spot)\* 
* No internet for navigation
* No ATMs (internet down)
* I definitely did not want to be out on the street in a city I didn't know at night with no lighting

I found a hotel, but they would only accept cash (no IOUs allowed).

**How I'd prepare for future emergencies:** 

* Have some emergency cash
* Always have emergency travel insurance: If the blackout lasted longer, I would want a flight out of this country ASAP. In that scenario, flights would be super expensive, better to have insurance cover it.
* Carry a power bank and download offline maps/resources you might need
* When I'm settled, in accommodation, always have a few liters of water, at least
* Carry extra supply of prescription medication, if needed
* Have some extra food, a few Clif bars or *something*

It was only possible to buy food with cash. Metro and Uber didn't work. Taxis worked if they knew your destination's address and if you could pay by cash.

People had to navigate by public transport and using a map, which they weren't used to. Younger people looked lost without internet. Older people pulled out a map and knew what to do.

Some travelers I talked to were genuinely freaking out because they couldn't speak anything of the local language. So, this is something to keep in mind, too.

Inter-city transport like trains and buses weren't running. Only public city buses.

Overall, this emergency was short-lived and manageable. If it had lasted longer, I could easily see how civility could have broken down quickly.

Luckily the weather was fine, if it was hot outside I imagine people would have had a short temper.

There were some tense moments in the airport. Some people tried to skip in the long line of people waiting in a long line at the bus stop, a fight almost broke out.

Of course, there are already basic emergency guidelines. All the preppers have already done all the work for us. However, I've been thinking how to adapt this for a nomadic situation.

**Let me know your thoughts or something that I missed!**

  
\* My accommodation cancelled my booking because I arrived a day late (flight was cancelled). I was refunded. Ended up staying at the same place because someone else cancelled, too.",71,2025-04-29 15:23:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1kaqlxm/preparing_for_major_power_outage_in_portugal_spain/

However, this time the police tolerated the celebrations, understanding the unusual circumstances.


What would happen in the UK?

1ka6hox,Missed two lessons as a teacher because of the power outage in Spain,chongyunsite,iTalki,"Hello! Today, there was a power outage in Spain that affected my area for 10 hours straight. For these 10 hours, I had no electricity, Internet, data or even phone service (no calls or SMS).

I tried to warn my students in case data came back temporarily but it didn't, and the messages didn't get through. Both of them marked it as incomplete under 'teacher did not attent, no notice'. Am I meant to accept this or reject it? I don't want to be punished for something that wasn't my fault. I went out of my house several times trying to get some phone service because I was so desperate. Both were package lessons. How can I proceed so that I'm not punished, but my students get their credits back?

I'm sorry if this has been asked before. I've been looking it up but the stress from this and other issues (like all of the food I had in the fridge and freezer, not being able to contact my family) is making me crazy so I'm posting on here for some help.

I showed Customer Service proof and they said they'd help after the claim has been completed. They told me to respond to the 'incomplete' claims but I'm not sure if I'm meant to accept or reject.

I don't want it to affect the attendance rates in my profile. I've never missed, and never been late to a class. If I reject and say ""other"" and give proof of the outage and choose that I want the credits to be transferred back to them, will I be able to keep full attendance in my profile?",29,2025-04-28 21:01:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/iTalki/comments/1ka6hox/missed_two_lessons_as_a_teacher_because_of_the/

*Right now, it's unclear what caused the blackout.* 

*Power outages over such a large area are unusual in these two countries.* 

*Parts of the Madrid underground are being evacuated due to the power outage, Spanish radio stations reported.*

*The outage has also caused major traffic jams in the city's center as traffic lights stopped working.*

*In Portugal, several subway cars were also evacuated. People have rushed into the streets to find out what is happening, according to the LUSA news agency.*

*Electricity was not only out in Spain and Portugal; the French news agency AFP reported that part of southern* [*France*](https://www.dw.com/en/france/t-19065412) *was also hit by the massive power outage.*

*The cause of the blackout was not immediately identified.*

*The* [*European Commission*](https://www.dw.com/en/european-commission/t-17455066) *said it was working with authorities to learn more about the power cuts across large parts of Spain, Portugal, and southern France.*

*""We are aware and working closely with the relevant authorities to better understand the situation. Notably we are in touch with the national authorities in Spain, Portugal as well as ENTSO-E \[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity\],"" a spokesperson for the commission told DW.*

*The cause of the outage is not yet clear.*

*According to Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Portuguese distributor E-Redes said the outage was due to ""a problem*

1kan7sv,Europe suffers $100 billion power outage and blames . . . swamp gas?,baltimore-aureole,economy,"https://preview.redd.it/rmwyxzjdtrxe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f5c2be3918013557a4a691e6977bbfe37274a06

***Photo above*** *- Impressive, even when standing still. Bullet train service between Madrid and Lisbon was cancelled yesterday due to a lack of voltage. More details to follow as they get figured out . . .*

*“Hola . . . is this Portugal? Spain calling here. Say, do you guys have electricity? Mierda!. . . neither do we! Any theories? Yeah, we tried that already - pushing the reset button. Okay . . . thanks . . . we’ll stay in touch.”*

That may or may not be an exact transcript of the call that took place between Madrid and Lisbon yesterday morning at 11:33 am local time. My sources will only say “possibly”. The more interesting part: 24 hours later, with power “mostly” turned back on, the experts still can’t figure out what happened.

Portugal’s first theory was *“unexpected temperature changes making the power lines oscillate”.* Uh-huh. The European version of swamp gas, with a veneer of climate change thrown in for good measure. This immediately struck me as BS, and Portugal was forced to walk back this lame story almost immediately.

Spain was quick to declare “definitely not a cyber-attack”, even though they don’t have any theories about what it actually was. Well, that’s fair enough. No need to panic the proletariat since Russia is already threatening to nuke a half dozen European capitals, and has been cutting transatlantic internet cables. If it had been a cyber-attack, some guy with a Rooshan accent would have told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to send a billion bitcoins somewhere, right?

In any case, Spanish trains are stuck in the middle of nowhere. People are trapped all day in elevators with no toilets. Airports can’t allow planes to take off or land. The lights in the hospital OR went out just as they were about to perform a liver transplant on some bullfighter who was gored the day before. It’s a mess. Estimates of economic losses run as high as $100 billion.

This is NOT a rant against our all-electric future. People have been dissing electricity ever since the days of Edison. The electric chair was used as the poster boy for dangerous home electrical wiring. Arguably electricity is safer – and less costly to use – than wood, coal, whale oil, candles, natural gas, and hamsters on treadmills.

There IS doubt about our legacy electric grid – in Europe, North America, and everywhere in the 3rd world. It is decaying, unreliable, and can’t deal with the constantly rising demand for volts, amps, and watts. I may revise this snark if someone in Spain or Portugal finally comes clean on why they had the worst blackout in the history of planet Earth. Cuba . . . pipe down. We know you're without electricity most days too. Just shut up, okay?

In any case, the Madrid Open tennis matches were cancelled yesterday for superstars like Novak Djokovic. Next best thing on clay courts after the French Open at Roland Garros stadium. Hopefully play will resume today. If Russia doesn’t nuke any European capitols or break any more ceasefires in Ukraine.

I’m just sayin’ . . .

1k9yx8b,Portugal Power Outages,Long_Disaster_311,travel,"I have a trip planned to Portugal and France starting next Thursday the 7th. The power outages in Portugal/Spain/parts of France are making me nervous (and I hope everyone who is affected is okay, this is crazy and I can't help thinking of hospitals, etc.). I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts from people who might also be in similar scenario.

From what I've read online, hopefully they will get power back soon and I think it's likely that things will be back on track by the time I am arriving (?). I am nervous that there might be a similar outage/this has opened my eyes to the possibility of other issues that might not be covered by my credit cards.

I hadn't originally booked a travel insurance plan because I have some coverage through my VentureX and Bilt cards (main legs of flights from US and back booked on VentureX, flights within Portugal and France booked on Bilt), so they provide trip delay coverage. However, their trip interruption insurance only covers loss of family member and insolvency of travel companies. Looking into some other travel insurance plans, their trip interruption also includes natural disasters that leave your destination uninhabitable. My first thought was that this might be helpful in the event of another power outage. However, with the Allianz plan I was looking at, there is an exclusion for foreseeable events, and I'm assuming this would be one since I'd be buying the plan after a similar event occurred, so if another outage happens they might argue that this could have been predicted.

Can anyone give this anxious traveler some advice on whether there is even a plan that would help me this late in the game? Am I better off just sticking with my credit card insurance because even if I did purchase another plan it wouldn't actually help in this scenario?

I'm in Spain where there was a huge nationwide blackout yesterday. Power was restored and now everyone we know in our town has internet except us. Even when we didn't have internet, our home wifi was visible in the list of available wifi networks via our MacOS and iOS devices. It's just that we'd try to connect and pages would obviously fail to load.

However, following a complete reset of router and modem, they're no longer visible at all. We can see all of the networks of neighbors but ours just doesn't appear. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing issue (because some parts of Spain are still impacted), our ISP isn't helping us. This is despite the fact that we've tried to explain that we believe it's more to do with the reset than the original outage.

Anyway, I'm really at a loss as to what to do. For now I'm using my mobile data but that has a limit. I would like to maybe access the router admin panel but I don't know my router's IP (I can't see it on the router or the router box).

1kajwqk,"Power returned to Spain early Tuesday after a major blackout disrupted flights, metros, and communications across Spain and Portugal. Authorities said over 99 percent of energy demand was restored. What caused it? - They say it was a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration’.",FXgram_,XGramatikInsights,"The Portuguese prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said that the issue originated in Spain. Portugal’s REN said a “rare atmospheric phenomenon” had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns.

REN said: “Due to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration’. These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.”

The European Council president, António Costa, who was Portugal’s prime minister from 2015 to 2024, said “there is no evidence that it was a cyber-attack”, but cautioned that the ultimate cause was still unclear. Senior European Commission vice-president Teresa Ribera also told Spain’s Radio 5 that there was no evidence of a deliberate act having caused the outage.

However, Spain’s national security council was convened on Monday to assess the outage. Portugal’s prime minister said it was too early to say for sure what caused the blackout.
